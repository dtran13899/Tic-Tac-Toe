# Tic-Tac-Toe
  Just like other Tic-Tac-Toe games, two players will either pick 'X' or 'O',
  and whoever has 3 marks in any rows, columns, or diagonals will win.  
  
  There are 3 different versions using Python, C++, and JavaScript:
    + In the Python and C++ versions, two players will play against each other.
    + In the JavaScript version, the player will play against the computer.
